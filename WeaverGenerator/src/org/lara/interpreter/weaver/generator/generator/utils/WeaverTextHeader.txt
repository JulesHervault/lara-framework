Weaver Implementation for [[WEAVERNAME]]<br>
Since the generated abstract classes are always overwritten, their implementation should be done by extending those abstract classes with user-defined classes.<br>
The abstract class {@link [[LINK]]} can be used to add user-defined methods and fields which the user intends to add for all join points and are not intended to be used in LARA aspects.
